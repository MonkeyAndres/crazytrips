            <h2>Learn about the story of Peter Malanga</h2>
            <p>Hi guys! I'm Peter and I'm going to tell you how crazy trips changed my life. I was a sad person because I could not fulfill his dream of traveling. I had no companions. I spent my summer evenings sitting in the window imagining trips and adventures. One day, surfing the internet I got to know Crazy trips. I could not believe it. What I wanted so much was in front of my eyes. With just a few clicks I was inside. I proposed my desired trip through Greece and in less than 3 days I already had companions. Those days were the best days of my life. I will repeat and I have joined a trip to Tanzania. I'll be enjoying it in a month. Now my life does make sense thanks to Crazy Trips.</p>
